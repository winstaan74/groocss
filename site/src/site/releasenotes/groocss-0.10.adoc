== DSL Improvements

* Added option (convertUnderline) to convert all underlines in style-classes to dashes.
* Added ability to use three or more element selectors without xor.
* Added ability to configure to use some element names as style-classes just in case you need “main” for example to be used as a style-class.
* Added ability to use 0x numbers as colors (color 0xabcdef for example)
