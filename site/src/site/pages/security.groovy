Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0 to 2.4.3
* Fixed in version 2.4.4

Impact:

Remote execution of untrusted code, DoS

Description:

When an application has Groovy on the classpath and uses standard Java serialization mechanisms to communicate between servers, or to store local data, it is possible for an attacker to bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability.

Mitigation:

Apache Groovy 2.4.4 is the first supported release under the Apache Software Foundation. It is strongly recommended that all users using serialization upgrade to this version.
If you cannot upgrade or rely on an older, unsupported version of Groovy, you can apply the following patch on the `MethodClosure` class (`src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/MethodClosure.java`):

```
 public class MethodClosure extends Closure {
+    private Object readResolve() {
+        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
+    }
```

Alternatively, you should make sure to use a custom security policy file (using the standard Java security manager) or make sure that you do not rely on serialization to communicate remotely.

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0 to 2.4.3
* Apache Groovy 2.4.4 to 2.4.7
* Fixed in version 2.4.8

Impact:

Remote execution of untrusted code, DoS

Description:

When an application with Groovy on classpath uses standard
Java serialization mechanisms, e.g. to communicate between servers
or to store local data, it is possible for an attacker to bake a special
serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized.
All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the
code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability.
This is similar to CVE-2015-3253 but this exploit involves extra
wrapping of objects and catching of exceptions which are now safe
guarded against.

Mitigation:

Users of Groovy relying on (de)serialization with the affected versions
should apply one of the following mitigations:

* Isolate the code doing the (de)serialization
* Upgrade to Apache Groovy 2.4.8 or later
* Users of older versions of Groovy can apply the following patch to the
`MethodClosure` class (`src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/MethodClosure.java`):

```
public class MethodClosure extends Closure {
+    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream) throws
IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
+        if (ALLOW_RESOLVE) {
+            stream.defaultReadObject();
+        }
+        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
+    }
```
